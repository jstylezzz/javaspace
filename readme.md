## LIVE DEMO! ##
You can read more about this project [on my portfolio](http://jarisenhorst.com/?p=pentry&id=29), there is also a (slightly modified) playable version of the game there. You can also play the full original (exact copy from this repo) on the [external page](http://jstylezzz.com/portfolio/jscriptGame/).

## BASE SCORE ##
Enemy blue gives 4 score and is pretty fast

Enemy yellow gives 1 score and is slow and easy to get

Enemy green gives 3 score and is pretty easy to get, but can be edgy sometimes

## BONUS SCORE ##
You will get slightly more score while you advance through the difficulty levels


#############

Difficulty will increase approx. each 36 seconds. Difficulty modifier is displayed on the bottom right.

Max amount of enemies active in the game is difficulty modifier + 4.
